[Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org/) for Docker
============

This is a "minimal alpine base" -- with alpine-baselayout installed.

This pulls in musl and busybox on top of [seansummers/alpine-apk-static](https://hub.docker.com/r/seansummers/alpine-apk-static/).

/sbin/apk.static should be used to install more packages, until you
add the shared library apk.
